EnchantioTrades is an add-on plugin for adding [Enchantio](https://modrinth.com/plugin/enchantio)'s enchantments to villager trades.

This plugin also adds a chance for curses to be added to enchantment books, given [Enchantio](https://modrinth.com/plugin/enchantio)'s extensive list of curses.

This plugin also adds compatibility with [Fletcher](https://modrinth.com/plugin/fletcher), specifically fixing the Volley enchantment to work with [Fletcher](https://modrinth.com/plugin/fletcher)'s custom arrows.
